# Easing Equation for SASS/SCSS

A list of easing cubic-bezier functions derived from [Robert Penner](http://twitter.com/robpenner)'s easing equation. Code was taken from the [LESS-CSS3-Mixins](https://github.com/MatthewWagerfield/LESS-CSS3-Mixins) github repository and then converted to SASS/SCSS.

## Usage

Assuming you have the `easing.scss` and your `site.scss` file:

`site.scss`
```scss
	@import "easing.scss";
```
